I use the article from [Lou's Pseudo-3d Page](http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/)
I have ported the [RacerJs](https://github.com/onaluf/RacerJS) in processing. 
I also use the graphics. The original code is MIT Licence and Creative-Common for the art.

for connect the wii-chuck and arduino you only need four wires
